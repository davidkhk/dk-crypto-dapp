# Connect your MetaMask wallet and start sending crypto

![](https://github.com/davidkhk/personal-portfolio/blob/netlify/src/assets/crypto-dapp.gif)

This is a project I built following a YT tutorial. As a beginner, following good tutorials is one os the best ways to learn how to code.

## What I learned:
- How to connect a regular React.js application to the blockchain and pair it to your Ethereum wallet using MetaMask
- How to write smart contracts on the Ethereum network using the Solidity programming language
- Styling with Tailwind CSS

If you're actually testing the funcionalities, please allow ample time for transations to go through as the website was hosted on Netlify for free.
